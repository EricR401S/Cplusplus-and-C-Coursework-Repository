Doing some basic checking for your submission

Step 1
Checking that cyoa-step1 compiles
g++ -o cyoa-step1 -std=gnu++98 -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 generate_story.cpp step1.cpp
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step1 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 1
------------------------------------


1.1: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 story1 story1 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
----here is what you printed on stderr---
