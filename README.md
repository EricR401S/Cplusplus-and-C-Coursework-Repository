# C++ (Cplusplus) and C ECE 551D Coursework Repository
This is a repository to store all of my ECE 551- Data Structures and Algorithms in C and C++ coursework. It was the very first time that I was learning this language, so the learning curve was high. However, now , I am confident in my skills. 

My best learning with C happened with Eval2, an assignment to parse story text. For my C++, the most robust learning ocurred with binary search trees, assignment 98, and the final Evaluative Assignment 993, where I needed to depth first search a graph of stories.
