# C++ (Cplusplus) and C ECE 551D Coursework Repository
This is a repository to store all of my ECE 551- Data Structures and Algorithms in C and C++ coursework. It was the very first time that I was learning this language, so the learning curve was high. However, now , I am confident in my skills. 

My best work was my work with binary search trees and the final Evaluative Assignment 3 : Assignments 98 and 993.
